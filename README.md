# Smart-Parking-Project
The project was created during my studies. I created a smart parking project based on the STM32 microcontroller using HC-SR04 motion sensors and LEDs. The project has a Master - Slave structure and communicates via I2C. The slave board monitors the presence of objects using motion sensors and turns on the LEDs. The master board receives data from the slave and displays it on the LCD display
